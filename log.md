### Day 10: January 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Write Your First App with Flutter, Part 1.

**Thoughts**: I have a solid application that I can see perform on the simulator. This codelab has given me an understanding of the overall process, but I need to learn and understand the components well enough to use on my own through practice.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
